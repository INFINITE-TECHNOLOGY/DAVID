## Purpose

`David` - a Polyglot Telegram Chat Bot.

`David` is based on [AbilityBot](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots) adding support of Plugins written in Groovy Script.

## In short

`David` helps to speed-up the development and enrollment of Telegram chat bots by taking care of the following verticals:

- SRE/DevOps
  - Deployment friendly - `David` is Spring Boot Application fully packaged and ready to be deployed anywhere
  - DB friendly - JPA support comes aboard (somehow a pain point of `TelegramBots` users)
  - Cloud-native - `David` provides extendable Push REST API. `David` is an extrovert! He can start the conversation, not only reply.
  - Logging - another pain point of `TelegramBots` users, though improved in latest versions (SLF4J) support. Yet `David` takes it to another level using [BlackBox](https://github.com/INFINITE-TECHNOLOGY/BLACKBOX) - you *won't even have to write logging code* yourself in plugins - it is added automatically.
- Development & built-in features\
    `David` already supports essential routines: 
  - User input handling - requesting and waiting for user input, and gracefully handling wrong data or junk
  - No wasted time on code infrastructure - `David` helps you to go straight to developing the features
  - Breaking your head how to structure your bot code? `David` provides you with the best structure - each command is in separate plugin.
  - User registration - `David` provides user repository with generic KYC attributes
- Business
  - Rapid requirement implementation using scripted language (Groovy)
  - Integration with other [i-t.io](https://i-t.io) products (such as [Pigeon](https://github.com/INFINITE-TECHNOLOGY/PIGEON)) adds value to your product with Email and SMS features
- UX
  - `David` is oriented towards less (or ideally NO) typing by user - thus making it easy to interact with using Telegram buttons rather than text commands.
  - Tired of missed user updates? Can't choose Web Hooks vs Poll? `David` uses **Poll** - the ONLY reliably working mechanism for getting Telegram updates.
- Security
  - `David` comes with JWT and OAuth2 support (via [Ascend](https://github.com/INFINITE-TECHNOLOGY/ASCEND) SECaaS platform)
