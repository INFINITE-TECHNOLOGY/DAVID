## Purpose

`David` is a ready-to-deploy archetype `Telegram` Chat Bot App, extendable with a user-defined plugins.

## In short

It takes only few clicks to deploy `David` - and you have a functioning (yet empty) chat bot.

Now you can develop your business functionality using `David` Plugins - each one representing a `command`.

The changes you do in the Plugins reflect in the chat immediately - you don't need to re-deploy or restart `David`.

This saves a lot of time and makes development more visualized.

> `David` comes pre-packaged and pre-configured to address typical use cases.
